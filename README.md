###Development of an Html Single Page App that helps to learn HTM Learning Algorithm.

This repository contains information for the engineering and planing of the app.

#### 1. Vision: 

An online App, that gives insides to the HTM Learning Algorithmus from Jeff Hawkings and his Company [Numenta] (http://numenta.com).
It informs with small interactive components about different parts of the brain and the HTM Learning algorithm.
We choose state of the are technolgies to learn even more while developing this app.

######Why: Because I can and for autodidactical reasons. Next to the HTM the choosen technologies are the focus for the learnings. 

#### 2. Technical Parts: 

Frontend: Angular2 with Material Design.
Backend: Scala mit Streams, Akka, MongoDB  und Rest interface.
Server: TBD for start maybe my DiskStation (slow connection...)
